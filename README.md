## Installation

On a VM that meets the minimum requirements from above run:

```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose/main/install.sh)
```

During installation there will be prompts for required environment variables.
After setting the variables, they are exported to an `override.env` file in the respective service directory.

### Content Node (Creator Node)

| Variable      | Description | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| creatorNodeEndpoint      | The DNS of your content node. If you haven't registered the service yet, please enter the url you plan to register       | https://cn1.operator.xyz |
| delegateOwnerWallet   | Public key for the service used to sign responses from the server. This wallet holds no tokens.       | `0x07bC80Cc29bb15a5CA3D9DB9D80AcA25eB967aFc` |
| delegatePrivateKey   | Private key associated with `delegateOwnerWallet`        | `2ef5a28ab4c39199085eb4707d292c980fef3dcc9dc854ba8736a545c11e81c4` |
| spOwnerWallet   | Public key that registered (or will register) the content node on chain. This wallet holds tokens.        | `0x92d3ff660158Ec716f1bA28Bc65a7a0744E26A98` |


### Discovery Node (Discovery Provider)

| Variable      | Description | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| audius_discprov_url      | The DNS of the discovery node. If you haven't registered the service yet, please enter the url you plan to register      | https://dn1.operator.xyz |
| audius_delegate_owner_wallet      | Public key for the service used to sign responses from the server. This wallet holds no tokens.     | `0x07bC80Cc29bb15a5CA3D9DB9D80AcA25eB967aFc` |
| audius_delegate_private_key      | Private key associated with `audius_delegate_owner_wallet`    | `2ef5a28ab4c39199085eb4707d292c980fef3dcc9dc854ba8736a545c11e81c4` |

<br />

### Customizing override.env
If you would like to maintain environment variables externally to the repository, you can use the following commands to override the path for the `override.env` file

```
audius-cli set-override-path discovery-provider <path-to-your-override>
audius-cli set-override-path discovery-provider --unset
```

## Upgrading
You can upgrade your service to the latest release by setting up autoupgrade:
```
audius-cli auto-upgrade
```

Or manually:
```
audius-cli upgrade
```

## Logging
Logging is enabled by _default_ to stream logs to an external logging service for debugging purposes. It is *strongly* recommended to keep logging enabled. The Audius logging stack uses [vector.dev](vector.dev) to ship container logs.

If there's a reason to turn logging off, it can be disabled via config:
 ```
 audius-cli set-config discovery-provider audius_logging_disabled true
 audius-cli launch discovery-provider
 ```

## Utilities
The [utilities folder](/utilities/) contains a set of scripts and utilities to manage services like:
- Running pre-registration health checks
- Delisting content on content nodes
- Automatic rewards claim script
