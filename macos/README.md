# MacOS Setup

This is meant for running a sandbox node on a macbook. Not tested or recommended for production.

Since this is currently a dev tool some dependencies are required before running this. 

You might need to add permissions to the install script:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Requirements:
- Docker Desktop for Mac
- Python3
